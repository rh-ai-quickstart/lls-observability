   "source": "# 🧪 Evaluating Llama Stack Models with Built-in Evaluation Framework\n\nThis notebook demonstrates **Model Evaluation** - a critical process for ensuring AI models perform reliably and meet quality standards before production deployment.\n\n**What is Model Evaluation?**\nModel evaluation transforms uncertainty into confidence by:\n- **Testing** models against known correct answers and expected behaviors\n- **Measuring** performance across different types of questions and tasks\n- **Identifying** potential issues and failure modes before deployment\n- **Comparing** different models or configurations systematically\n\n**Why Evaluation Matters:**\nInstead of hoping your model works correctly, evaluation provides objective metrics and insights:\n- **Quality Assurance**: Verify models meet performance thresholds\n- **Regression Testing**: Ensure changes don't break existing functionality  \n- **Model Selection**: Compare different models to choose the best one\n- **Continuous Improvement**: Track performance over time and identify areas for enhancement\n\n**Llama Stack's Evaluation Framework:**\nLlama Stack provides three core APIs for comprehensive evaluation:\n- 📊 **`/datasetio` + `/datasets`** - Managing evaluation datasets\n- 🎯 **`/scoring` + `/scoring_functions`** - Running scoring functions  \n- 📈 **`/eval` + `/benchmarks`** - Comprehensive evaluation workflows\n\nLet's explore both strict and flexible evaluation methods to build robust quality assurance! 🚀"

   "source": "## 🏗️ Understanding Evaluation Methods\n\nLlamaStack provides **two primary evaluation approaches** that work together to provide comprehensive model testing:\n\n### 1. 🎯 Exact Matching: `subset_of`\nThis method performs strict string matching:\n- **Speed**: Lightning fast - simple substring search\n- **Precision**: Exact character-by-character matching \n- **Use Case**: Perfect for factual questions with clear, specific answers\n- **Limitation**: Case-sensitive and inflexible to paraphrasing\n\n**Example**: \"Paris\" ✅ matches \"The capital of France is Paris\"  \n**Problem**: \"shakespeare\" ❌ fails to match \"William Shakespeare\" (case difference)\n\n### 2. 🤖 Semantic Evaluation: `llm_as_judge`  \nThis method uses AI to understand meaning:\n- **Flexibility**: Handles paraphrasing, case differences, and context\n- **Intelligence**: Understands semantic equivalence and factual consistency\n- **Use Case**: Complex answers requiring interpretation and reasoning\n- **Cost**: Requires additional LLM inference for each evaluation\n\n**Example**: \"shakespeare\" ✅ semantically matches \"William Shakespeare wrote Romeo and Juliet\"\n\n### 3. 📊 Academic Benchmarks: Multiple Choice + Regex\nFor standardized testing:\n- **Structure**: Multiple choice questions (A, B, C, D format)\n- **Parsing**: Regex extraction of letter choices from model responses\n- **Scoring**: Binary correct/incorrect based on exact letter match\n- **Use Case**: Academic knowledge, reasoning, and comprehension testing\n\n**The Best Approach**: Use both methods together for comprehensive evaluation:\n- `subset_of` for quick sanity checks and exact factual verification\n- `llm_as_judge` for nuanced understanding and complex reasoning\n- Academic benchmarks for standardized performance comparison\n\n## 📦 Install Required Packages\n\nInstall the evaluation dependencies:"

This addresses the case sensitivity and rigidity issues we saw with `subset_of`.\n\n**How `llm_as_judge` works:**\n1. **AI-Powered**: Uses another LLM to evaluate the semantic similarity between answers\n2. **Context-Aware**: Understands meaning, not just exact character matching\n3. **Flexible**: Handles paraphrasing, case differences, and contextual variations\n4. **Explainable**: Provides reasoning for each evaluation decision\n\n**Judge Prompt Strategy:**\nOur judge will compare factual content while ignoring style and format differences. It evaluates using these categories:\n- **(A)** Generated response is a subset of expected (correct but incomplete)\n- **(B)** Generated response is a superset of expected (correct with extra detail)  \n- **(C)** Responses contain the same factual details (perfect match)\n- **(D)** There is factual disagreement (incorrect)\n- **(E)** Answers differ but differences don't matter factually (acceptable variation)\n\n**Important Note**: In production, use a different, more capable model as the judge than the one being evaluated. For this tutorial, we're using the same model for simplicity, but this \"self-judging\" approach is not ideal for production evaluation."
