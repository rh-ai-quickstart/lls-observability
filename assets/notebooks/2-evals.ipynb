    "- **(A)** Generated response is a subset of expected (correct but incomplete)\n",
    "- **(B)** Generated response is a superset of expected (correct with extra detail)  \n",
    "- **(C)** Responses contain the same factual details (perfect match)\n",

    "\n",
    "**What you accomplished:**\n",
    "- **🎯 Basic Evaluation**: Implemented exact string matching with `subset_of` for fast, precise testing\n",
    "- **🤖 Semantic Evaluation**: Used `llm_as_judge` for flexible, context-aware evaluation with explanations\n",
    "- **📚 Dataset Testing**: Evaluated on real-world SimpleQA dataset for unbiased performance measurement\n",
    "- **🎓 Academic Benchmarks**: Tested structured multiple-choice questions with regex parsing for standardized comparison\n",
    "- **📊 End-to-End Pipeline**: Built complete evaluation workflows from question to performance metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Technical Insights:**\n",
    "- **Exact vs Semantic**: `subset_of` is fast but rigid; `llm_as_judge` is flexible but requires more resources\n",
    "- **Dataset Diversity**: Real datasets reveal different failure modes than handcrafted examples  \n",
    "- **Structured Evaluation**: Academic benchmarks provide standardized, comparable performance metrics\n",
    "- **Error Analysis**: Each method reveals different aspects of model capabilities and limitations\n",
    "\n",

    "|--------|-------|-------------|----------|------|\n",
    "| `subset_of` | ⚡ Fast | 🔒 Rigid | Quick sanity checks | 💰 Free |\n",
    "| `llm_as_judge` | 🐌 Slower | 🤸 Flexible | Nuanced evaluation | 💰💰 LLM calls |\n",
    "| Multiple Choice + Regex | ⚡ Fast | 📏 Structured | Academic benchmarks | 💰 Model calls only |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Production Best Practices:**\n",
    "1. **Multi-Method Approach**: Use all three methods together for comprehensive coverage\n",
    "2. **Judge Model Selection**: Use stronger models (Llama 3.3 70B, 405B) as judges, not the model being evaluated\n",
    "3. **Dataset Rotation**: Regularly test on new, unseen datasets to prevent overfitting\n",
    "4. **Error Analysis**: Investigate failure patterns to guide model improvements\n",
    "5. **Benchmark Tracking**: Monitor performance trends over time and model versions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advanced Evaluation Patterns to Explore:**\n",
    "- **Multi-turn Conversations**: Evaluate dialogue consistency and context retention\n",
    "- **Tool Use Evaluation**: Test agent capabilities with external tools and APIs\n",
    "- **Safety & Alignment**: Evaluate harmful content detection and refusal behaviors\n",
    "- **Domain-specific Benchmarks**: Create custom evaluation datasets for your specific use case\n",
    "- **Human Evaluation**: Combine automated metrics with human judgment for complex tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps:**\n",
    "- Scale up evaluation with larger datasets (100s-1000s of examples)\n",
    "- Implement automated evaluation pipelines for continuous testing\n",
    "- Create custom evaluation datasets for your specific domain or use case\n",
    "- Set up performance monitoring and alerting for production model deployment\n",
